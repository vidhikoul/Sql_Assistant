## AI SQL Assistant

## Overview
AI SQL Assistant is an intelligent tool that helps users interact with databases efficiently. It suggests database schemas, generates SQL queries from natural language input, supports Trino and Spark SQL dialects, and incorporates user feedback to improve query generation. The project is built using React, Node.js, and MySQL, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Features
âœ… Schema Suggestion: Get recommendations for designing optimized database schemas.
âœ… SQL Query Generation: Convert natural language input into SQL queries.
âœ… Multi-Dialect Support: Works with Trino and Spark SQL dialects.
âœ… Interactive Query Editor: Provides auto-completion and syntax highlighting for SQL queries.
âœ… User Feedback Learning: Improves SQL generation accuracy over time based on user interactions.
